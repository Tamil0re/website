# Girls Who Code at USM — Website

Empowering the next generation of female technologiest through community, education and real-world coding experience.

This repository contains a simple front-end project (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) used for workshops, portfolio demos, and community outreach.

## About

Girls Who Code USM is a student-led organization dedicated to closing the gender gap in technology by inspiring, educating, and equipping students with the computing skills needed to pursue 21st-century opportunities.

## Quick overview

- Project type: Static website (no build step required)
- Files of interest:
  - `index.html` — the main page
  - `style.css` — stylesheet
  - `script.js` — interactive behavior

## Features

- Minimal, easy-to-read code suitable for beginners
- Clear separation of structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JS)

## Quickstart — view locally

1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already):

	git clone https://github.com/Girls-Who-Code-USM/website.git

2. Open `index.html` in your browser. On Windows you can double-click the file or use a lightweight local server for better behavior (recommended when using fetch/XHR or routing):

	# Use Python's simple server (works with Python 3)
	python -m http.server 8000

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

## Development notes

- The project doesn't require Node, npm, or any other tooling. If you want to add a build step, consider adding a `package.json` and a simple dev server (for example, `live-server` or using Vite for faster reloads).
- Keep JS behavior unobtrusive: prefer feature detection and avoid global namespace pollution.

## Testing changes

- Manual testing: open `index.html` after edits and verify layout and interactions.
- Accessibility: use browser devtools Lighthouse and check color contrast, headings, and alt text for images.
